		<div class="c">Design<hr><p>Eco-design, ecological design, sustainable design, circular design, design for the environment or as we like to call it - good design that benefits both people and the environment.Eco-design is an approach to designing products that takes into consideration the environmental impacts throughout a products lifecycle.Greater understanding of our impact on the environment is leading consumers to make informed purchases. Consumers want to buy quality products that are unique, durable, long-lasting, eco-friendly and help us be a less wasteful society.Gone are the days of the “buy-use-throw away” process based on the linear economy. Instead, we see a transitioning to a circular process designed to maximise a products value and minimise waste. This is where eco-design comes in with its goal .</p></div>
		<div class="d">Programs<hr><p>Design for Sustainability: A Step-by-Step Approach is the latest in the D4S publication series. A global guide for designers and industry, it provides support to ecodesign novices and those looking to further their understanding of the field. The manual focuses on three different design approaches: redesign of existing products, radical sustainable product innovation and new product development. An additional section acts as a comprehensive 'how-to' guide for first time users. Online materials - including case studies, additional design and management tools and worksheets - compliment the print version. The manual is the result of a long term partnership between UNEP, Delft University of Technology and international D4S experts from the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, France, Germany</p></div>
		<div class="e">Development<hr><p>Sustainable development has its roots in ideas regarding sustainable forest management, which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.[19][20][21] In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, John Evelyn argued, in his 1662 essay Sylva, that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources." In 1713, Hans Carl von Carlowitz, a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony published Sylvicultura economics, a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield. </p></div>
